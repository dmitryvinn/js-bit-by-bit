# JavaScript: Learning Bit by Bit

## Intro
Don't know about you, but I have very little time. My attention span is short. But I still have an urge to learn (and to share what I learn). This small project, JavaScript: Learning Bit by Bit, is my attempt at combining my lack of time with a desire to learn about JS.

## What this is
I will regularly post short code snippet covering some of the basics of JavaScript. Since I am a strong-believer in developers speaking through code, this is the medium I chose to share my knowledge through

## Where 
I will be posting these "snippets of knowledge" on my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/DmitryVinnik). However, since I can only post images, I want people to have access to the source code to help with accessibility and allow you to actually execute the code. 

## Outline
Since I'm usually learning bit-by-bit, this project's agenda is also a bit unorganized.

I will begin this project by covering the basics of JavaScript where I focus on JS built-in objects.

Here is the current outline of what's covered:
1) Array:
    1.1) Array: Creation and Access

## Resources
There are many places to learn from, but for the basics of JavaScript, I'm currently using:

1) [W3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/)
2) [MDN Web Docs: JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/)
